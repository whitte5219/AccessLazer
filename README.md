# Webpage repository (generated)

This repository contains the exact files extracted from the uploaded archive.

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload the contents of this repository (all files and folders) to the repository root.
3. To serve via **GitHub Pages**, in the repository settings enable Pages from the `main` branch (root) or from `gh-pages` branch, or set the site to serve from the `docs/` folderâ€”no build step required for static sites.

## Notes
- I preserved the original files exactly.
- If your site expects a specific build step (e.g., a static site generator), run that locally and then upload the generated `dist` or `public` folder instead.
